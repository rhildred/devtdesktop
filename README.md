# devtdesktop
This is my current development environment bootstrap to be run with curl to set up a user with sudo and docker groups. Start up a Ubuntu Amazon instance and run:

`bash <(curl https://rhildred.github.io/devtdesktop/toaster.sh) <your desired username here>`

Sadly I can't find a way to get visual studio code without using chrome. I did install Chrome as a way of getting Visual Studio Code and instructions for most everything else. Download Visual Studio Code with chrome and install it with gdebi. Something like `sudo gdebi ~/Downloads/code........deb`
