# devtdesktop
This is my current development environment bootstrap to be run with curl to set up a user with sudo and docker groups.

`bash <(curl https://rhildred.github.io/devtdesktop/toaster.sh) <your desired username here>`

Sadly I can't find a way to get visual studio code without using chrome. Download with chrome and install code with gdebi. Something like `sudo gdebi ~/Downloads/code........deb`
